- 👋 Hi, I’m @lulubumps and this is my non-streamer side... so, since I'm on Github, this is my nerdy side (yes, codes and codes).
- 👀 I’m interested in videogames, music and PHP programming (my forte is Laravel).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to program the love of your life.
- 💞️ Believe it or not, I have updated the README.md to say that I have more hidden repositories than public ones..

<!---
lulubumps/lulubumps is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears in my GitHub profile.
If you get to read this, I love you very much.
