- 👋 Hi, I’m @lulubumps and this is my non-streamer side... so, since I'm on Github, this is my nerdy side (yes, codes and codes).
- 👀 I’m interested in videogames, music and PHP programming (my forte is Laravel).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to program the love of your life.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on osu! (nah, jk).
